# LaaNo: Link as a Note

[LaaNo](https://laano.net) is an Android app which is designed to simplify the access to the information found on the Web and give more power to manage it.

* The app allows to bind Notes to Links and, at the same time, providing independent access to them.
* Notes can be used as background information or as flashcards.
* Two-way data sync is possible via [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).
